        <h2>The Creating</h2>
        
        <p class="dropcap">The James Bond series focuses on a fictional character created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, (James Bond) is the dullest name I ever heard.<span>â€“Ian Fleming</span></p>

        <h2>Ian's Novels</h2>

        <p>On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year.After completing the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published. Since Fleming's death in 1964 seven other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations.</p>
